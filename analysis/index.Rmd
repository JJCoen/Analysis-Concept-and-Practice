# **My Conceptual Approach**

I start by reflecting upon the research question and expressing it in scientific terms.  This generally indicates the data and which attributes of the data I require for analysis.  This leads to consideration of the appropriate method for analysis.  

## Statistical and Mathematical Foundation
in order to express the primary research question in scientific terms.

1. Statistics.  
[U. Texas, Austin, Foundations of Data Analysis](https://github.com/JJCoen/Certificates/blob/master/UTAustinX-Foundations-of-Data-Analysis-pt-2-Inference.pdf)
1. Linear Algebra.  
[U. Texas, Austin, Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontier](https://github.com/JJCoen/Certificates/blob/master/UT5_04x.pdf)


## Analytical Framework
* __Primary Research Question__  
    + By expressing the primary research question in scientific terms, it identifies properties that can be measured and assessed.
    + This informs what data to collect.
    
* __Data Evaluation__
    + Is the available data sufficient to carry out the study?
    + What processing of the data needs to occur?
    + What attributes give a compact description / summary of the data.
    
* __Analytical Method__
    + Which method can best answer the primary research question

__Data Science__

> "Success in a datascience project comes, not from access to any one exotic tool, 
> but from having quantifiable goals,good methodology, cross-discipline interactions,
> and a repeatable workflow"  
> Nina Zumel and John Mount, Practical Data Science with R



__Information content of available data__  

> "The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure 
> that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data"
